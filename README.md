This repository contains the KiCad files for an LoRa shield for Arduino Uno and some examples that may help you to get running your LoRa-based applications with the power of an Arduino UNO 

- The folder named "LoRA_PHY_RH" refer to the communication
P2P by the Physical layer of LoRa,in here you can find 2 examples one as the Transmitter (Which also  is capable of receive information) and the second as the receiver (Which also is capable of transmit e information), both examples work with the [RadioHead](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/) library  

- The folder named "LoRA_PHY" refer to the communication
P2P by the Physical layer of LoRa,in here you can find 2 examples one as the Transmitter and the second as the receiver, both examples work with the Official [LoRa](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa) library from arduino.

- The folder named LoRa_WAN refer to the communication by a LoRaWAN network from your device to internet, by the two methods that exist OTAA and ABP, both examples were created to read an GPS or/and temperature from one analogic sensor attached to the analog input.
